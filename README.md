# Programming Development

Please use this repository for the code you are developing as part of the second assignment.

The structure is as follows:

```
.
+-- README.md
+-- src
|   +-- <your files here>
+-- tests
|   +-- <your files here>
+-- doc
|   +-- <your files here>
```

You should store your code files in the `src` directory, your test files in the `tests` directory and your documentation in the `doc` directory.

If you have any questions or comments, please get in touch with us via the usual methods.
